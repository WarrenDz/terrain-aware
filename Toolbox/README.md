# Terrain Aware Toolbox
This toolbox does a bunch of neat stuff with terrain data and then some equally absurd stuff with arcade expressions. Intrigued? Keep reading!

## Create Terrain Aware Layers
This tool is the core of the toolbox. Itâ€™s the heavy lifter and creates all of the terrain aware data framework that is needed to render the cartographic outputs. The steps involved largely follow those outlined in [this walkthrough](https://warrenrdavison.wixsite.com/maps/post/revisiting-hachure-lines-dynamic-hachure-contours-in-arcgis-pro) with the exception of a few enhancements that were implemented in the process of scripting the python tool ([below](https://github.com/WarrenDz/terrain-aware/tree/main/Toolbox#processing-steps)).

### Parameters
This tool requires the following inputs in order to generate a contour output and a polygon dataset with _'terrain aware'_ attributes.

#### Input DEM
The input for the tool should be a raw DEM (unless you'd like an additional smoothing pass performed prior to running the tool).

#### Output Contours
Specify the location for an output feature class of contour lines. These contours will have a `contour`, `slope`, and `aspect` attribute.

#### Output Polygons
Specify the location for an output feature class of 'terrain polygons'. These polygons represent a geographic union of the generalized slope and aspect rasters generated by the tool. These polygons will also have a `slope` and `aspect` attribute.

#### Terrain Fidelity
This parameter determines the generalization of the aspect in the output. Using this parameter you can create more or less generalized outputs.

- `LOF_FI` partitions aspect values into 60 degrees bins resulting in 6 output aspect.
- `MID_FI` partitions aspect values into 45 degree bins resultsing in 8 output aspect.
- `HI_FI` partitions aspect values into 30 degree bins resulting in 12 output aspect.

#### Processing Extent
This parameter sets the `processing extent` environment variable. This can be set using `[DEM_EXTENT, LAYER_EXTENT, DISPLAY_EXTENT]`. I included this parameter since the reclassification of the slope raster uses the **Slice Tool** with a `Natural Breaks` classification. Therefore, controlling the scope of the inputs was essential to ensure that complex or extreme terrain outside of the area of interest did not skew the classification of terrain features within the scope.

##### Extent Layer (optional)
When the `Processing Extent = LAYER_EXTENT` this parameter becomes available for the user to specify a layer within the map to define the area of interest. The tool will select the first feature within that layer to determine the processing extent. Therefore, a simple polygon feature class delimiting the cartographic area of interest is ideal.

#### Minimum Polygon Area
This parameter determines the smallest allowable cluster of cells that will persist after a **Region Group** processing. This generalizes the conversion from raster to the individual slope and aspect rasters. This step aides in generalizing the terrain polygons and reduces fragmentation in the output. However, it does not dictate the smallest allowable polygon in the final output after the union.

#### Contour Interval
This parameter determines the spacing between contours lines in the output contours.

#### Smoothing Neighbourhood
This parameter determines the neighbourhood (in cells) that will be used to perform a **Focal Statistics** `Mean` operation. Again through generalization we're aiming for a less fragementated output.

#### Azimuth
As with the hillshade tool, the azimuth sets the direction of the light source. For ease of processing, we generalize this into 30 degree increments of 360 and assign it the appropriate bin.


### Processing Steps
1.	Smoothes the DEM using a Focal Statistics Mean operation with the neighbourhood circle size dictated by the input parameter.
2.	Creates a Slope and Aspect raster from the smoothed DEM.
3.	Extracts cells from the Slope raster where their value is less than 5 degrees (low slope areas) these will be omitted in further processing.
4.	Slices the Slope raster to reclassify the values using Natural Breaks as the classification scheme.
5.	Reclassifies the Aspect raster into the number of bins determined by the 'Terrain Fidelity' and assigns attribute values accordingly.
6.	Filters both the Slope and Aspect rasters with a Majority Filter operation.
7.	Cleans both the Slope and Aspect rasters with a Boundary Clean operation.
8.	Groups both the Slope and Aspect rasters with a Region Group operation.
9.	Extracts regions that are smaller than the area dictated by the Minimum Polygon Area parameter.
10.	Nibbles both the Slope and Aspect rasters to fill in the regions that were removed by the extract operation.
11.	Converts both the Slope and Aspect rasters to polygons and renames/removes some fields for clarity.
12.	Unions the new Slope and Aspect polygons to create a new terrain polygon layer.
13.	Creates contour lines from the smoothed DEM.
14.	Intersects the contour lines with the terrain polygons to transfer Slope and Aspect attributes to the contour lines.
15. Adds attribute index to `SLOPE` and `ASPECT` columns of the output layers to optimize rendering.


## Style Terrain Aware Layers (*requires workaround)
*I haven't been able to workaround a python bug at the moment so in order to apply the symbology of the various techniques, you'll need to* `Import symbology...` manually for the time being.
![Import symbology...](https://github.com/WarrenDz/terrain-aware/blob/main/Images/ImportSymbology.png)

Once the bug is resolved or a workaround found, you can use this tool to apply one of the [predefined styles](https://github.com/WarrenDz/terrain-aware/tree/main/Styles). The tool updates the styling of the tool with one of the available styles, based on the geometry of the terrain aware layer, and attempts to adjust the rendering settings to adjust for the intended map scale.

The styles I've included are just samples that I've dreamt up while experimenting, but they showcase some of the possibilities and are useful examples of how the effects can be configured. Try them out, break open the expressions and see how they impact the rendering, and try to tweak them for your own use!

All of the styles included with this toolbox rely on [Attribute-driven Symbology](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/layer-properties/attribute-driven-symbology.htm) and make extensive use of [Arcade Expressions](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/) to modulate how symbology is rendered. Using these techniques features can be rendered with relatively few symbology layers that are dynamic thanks to the logic of the expressions. The greatest benefit is that the geoprocessing tool can be run once for your area of interest and the rendering can be endlessly configured without having to re-run the processing steps.

### Parameters
This tool requires the following inputs in order to style the selected _'terrain aware'_ layer. *Right now this tool is currently non-functional, it will successfully run but due to a python BUG the tool doesn't actually generate a result (see development goals below).

#### Selected Style
Used to select one of the pre configured styles available with this tool.

#### Input Layer
The layer to which the style will be applied. This layer should be an ouput from the `CreateTerrainAwareLayers` tool and must have the required fields present. The geoometry of the available layers will be based on the style that was selected (some require polygons, others contours).

#### Intended Map Scale
The pre-configured styles that are packaged with this tool have all been configured to display best at `1:24,000`. By inputting a map scale my intent was to develop a scaling ratio that could be used to adjust the render settings for these layer files via the python access to the CIM and take a 'best guess' at what the settings should be to display well at the desired scale. The user would then need to make adjustments as they see fit.


# Development Goals
- [x] Correct the `slope_min` criteria of the Swiss-ish layer file to fix the "broken contours" in low slope areas.
- [ ] Author a `elevation_subset` modifier expression that can be applied to various expressions that allows the user to apply a 'defintion query` and only render specific contour intervals of the _'terrain-aware'_ contours.
- [ ] Review all arcade expressions and ensure the default value is supplied as `Text(0)`. This will resolve odd cases when the symbol panel expects the parameter as text vs integer.
- [ ] Review all arcade expressions and convert any instances of technique parameters ex. `hachure_min` to a more consistent `render_min`. This will allow for consistent code if Cartography Information Model (CIM) is achieved.
- [ ] Determine if `arcpy.ApplySymbologyFromLayer_management(in_layer=in_layer, in_symbology_layer=stylePath)` is achievable from python within the `StyleTerrainAwareLayers` tool (appears to be a bug as per BUG-000106281, BUG-000108497).
  - [ ] If we can apply symbology from python, determine if there is a loose `scaling_factor` or relationship between `map scale` and `render parameters`. If so, we can estimate the render settings based on the scale provided by the user as an input to the tool.
  - [ ] With a calculated `scaling_factor` we could access the arcade expressions within the layer file and update the `render parameters` prior to applying the layer file to a layer in the map (this is primarily applicable when the user does not set a `reference scale` and intends to author the map at a scale other than `1:24,000`).
