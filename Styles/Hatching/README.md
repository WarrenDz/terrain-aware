# Hatching Style (Polygon)
This style uses a hatching fill with varying stroke wweights to depict the terrain.

### Parameters
#### Stroke Weight
The `Lines_StrokeWeight.lxp` arcade expression has been applied to the `Size` parameter within the **Symbol Pane**. As the terrain becomes more intense and/or shaded, the stroke weight will be increased.

### Hatching Usage Notes:
Duplicating the line fill symbol and rotating it 90 degrees would produce a neat cross-hatch effect.
